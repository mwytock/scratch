I am second year graduate student, but I wanted to submit a short explanation of my Ph.D. career in order to resolve any confusion. In particular, I began the Machine Learning Ph.D. program at CMU in 2010. After my first year, I took a one year leave of absence during which I returned to Google in order to work on an early-stage project. In August of this year, at the start of the 2012--2013 school year, I returned to the program and began my second year.
